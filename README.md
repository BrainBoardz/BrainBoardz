### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**BrainBoardz/BrainBoardz** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

BrainBoardz is a revolutionary modular Mini PCE Express (mPCIe) based system that greatly simplifies circuit board design and the development of custom microcontroller based boards.  Through the use of our expanding range of hot-swappable Neuron modules and BrainBoardz prototyping boards anyone can easily develop custom projects to harness the impressive capabilities of the latest generation Espressif microcontroller. Simply connect an ESP32-S3 based Neuron module to one of our many BrainBoardz, connect a USB cable and you are ready to go! Neurons provide full access to the extensive range of capabilities provided by the cutting edge ESP32-S3, and they can also function as standalone modules if required.

Our mission is to empower designers to develop their own circuit board designs based on our advanced surface mount friendly mPCIe architecture. The entire BrainBoardz system is fully documented, open source and 100% license free.

Neurons can be easily added or removed from a BrainBoardz. The mPCIe connector approach supports ultra-low profile projects and guarantees microcontroller module re-usability. There are no fragile pins to contend with in the BrainBoardz system. Itâ€™s simply Plug and Code. Neurons boards provide for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Touch Sensing and SD Card Storage.
