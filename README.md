This is the official repository for the Neuron and the BrainBoardz system. The Neurons are ESP32-S3 based modules that support Arduino and Circuit Python. 

BrainBoardz is a revolutionary modular Mini PCE Express (mPCIe) based system that greatly simplifies circuit board design and the development of custom microcontroller based boards.  Through the use of our expanding range of hot-swappable Neuron modules and BrainBoardz prototyping boards anyone can easily develop custom projects to harness the impressive capabilities of the latest generation Espressif microcontroller. Simply connect an ESP32-S3 based Neuron module to one of our many BrainBoardz, connect a USB cable and you are ready to go! Neurons provide full access to the extensive range of capabilities provided by the cutting edge ESP32-S3, and they can also function as standalone modules if required.

Neurons can be easily added or removed from a BrainBoardz. The mPCIe connector approach supports ultra-low profile projects and guarantees microcontroller module re-usability. There are no fragile pins to contend with in the BrainBoardz system. It’s simply Plug and Code. Neurons boards provide for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Touch Sensing and SD Card Storage.

If you would like to learn more about BrainBoardz our website is http://www.brainboardz.com

Our mission is to empower designers to develop their own circuit board designs based on our advanced surface mount friendly mPCIe architecture. The entire BrainBoardz system is fully documented, open source and 100% license free. You are welcome to design your own Neuron or BrainBoardz board. We do not allow 3rd party boards to use our name or logo, but you are welcome to indicate "BrainBoardz Compatible" on your board if it is 100% compatible and it is manufactured using a Lead Free process.  Please ensure that you follow our design guidelines very closely. The pin assignments have to be 100% compatible and the connector placement is extremely critical.  Also, please ensure that Neurons run properly (including the SD-card, Blinky and the Piezo) on your design.  If you design a really  interesting board we would love to see it! The PCB designs and schematics for the Neuron and BrainBoardz are released under the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license Version 4.0. Our code is released under the GPLv3 license.
